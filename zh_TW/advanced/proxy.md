# Configure Reverse Proxy

RatPanel v2.4.10+ comes with a built-in reverse proxy configuration generator, which you can access through the top right corner of the site rewrite configuration page.

Note: If you encounter issues with static resources like CSS/JS not loading properly after setting up a reverse proxy, please remove the **Do not log static files** section from the site's main configuration file.
